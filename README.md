## Various physics-based simulations using python

- Masses and Springs simulates point masses connected by springs with a given equilibrium distance.  The plotting is rendering using the PyQtGraph package, which utilizes PyOpenGL.

- Bouncing balls are similiar simulations using the MATPLOTLIB plotting library.  There are both 2D and 3D simulations

- L-system simulates a fractal tree pattern generated by [recursive substitution of a simple rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) to generate a long "sentence" of commands.  These commands take the form of "turtle graphics"-like commands, but with save and restore methods as well.
  - the first file uses the turtle python libray
  - the second uses matplotlib to imitate the turtle

- Lorenz is the classical [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) demonstration.  Here I use matplotlib's animation function.
